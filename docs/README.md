# OctoAcme Project Management Process Documentation

## Purpose

This documentation provides a complete guide to how OctoAcme runs cross-functional projects. These process docs help new teammates quickly understand our approach, ensure consistent delivery practices across teams, and serve as a reference for project planning, execution, and continuous improvement. Use these documents to align on roles, responsibilities, artifacts, and workflows throughout the project lifecycle.

## Process Areas Overview

### Project Initiation
The **Project Initiation** process defines the initial steps to validate and authorize new work. It focuses on confirming business needs, identifying stakeholders, defining success criteria, and creating a lightweight project one-pager. This phase ensures alignment before moving into detailed planning and helps teams make informed go/no-go decisions.

### Project Planning
The **Project Planning** process turns approved initiatives into actionable plans and backlogs. It involves breaking work into shippable increments, identifying dependencies and risks, creating prioritized backlogs with acceptance criteria, and establishing Definition of Done. Planning also includes estimating scope, defining release timelines, and preparing initial test plans.

### Execution & Tracking
The **Execution & Tracking** process provides guidance for managing day-to-day delivery and tracking progress toward milestones. It covers team rhythms (standups, syncs, demos), project board workflows, pull request conventions, quality and testing standards, reporting metrics, and blocker escalation paths. This ensures transparency and maintains delivery momentum.

### Release & Deployment
The **Release & Deployment** process standardizes how features move to production to reduce risk and improve observability. It defines release types (patch, minor, major), pre-release requirements, deployment checklists, smoke testing procedures, and rollback playbooks. The goal is to enable safe, repeatable, and well-communicated releases.

### Retrospective & Continuous Improvement
The **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement** process helps teams capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements. It defines when and how to run retrospectives (after sprints, releases, or incidents), provides structure for gathering feedback, and establishes how to track and measure improvement actions.

### Risk Management & Communication
The **Risk Management & Communication** process explains how to identify, assess, manage, and communicate risks and dependencies. It includes maintaining a risk register, stakeholder communication templates, escalation paths, and guidance for weekly status updates and incident communications to keep all parties informed.

### Roles & Personas
The **Roles & Personas** document defines typical roles and responsibilities used across OctoAcme projects. It describes the accountabilities, goals, and communication patterns for Developers, Product Managers, and Project Managers. These persona definitions help frame scenarios and ensure clear ownership throughout the project lifecycle.
